# Reading Span Test for Adolescent Speakers of Brazilian Portuguese (in press)

This repository contains the sentences used in two tests of working memory capacity, the Brazilian Portuguese version (Tomitch, 2003) of the Reading Span Test (RST, Daneman & Carpenter, 1980) and the Reading Span Test for Adolescent Speakers of Brazilian Portuguese (RSTA, in press). The latter was developed as part of a study that compared the tests to check the reliability of the RSTA with this specific category of participants, adolescent speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, in comparison with the RST. The study used the tests in two conditions that are explained in the article reporting the results of the study (in press). The files in the repository are briefly described in sequence.

* **RST_sentences.txt** and **RSTA_sentences.txt** contain the sentences used in the RST and in the RSTA.
* **RST_references.txt** and **RSTA_references.txt** contain the list of references of the sentences used in the RST and in the RSTA.
* **RST_order_strict.txt** and **RSTA_order_strict.txt** contain information about the order and grouping of the sentences in the sets and levels of the respective test in the strict condition.
* **RST_order_lenient.txt** and **RSTA_order_lenient** contain information about the order and grouping of the sentences in the sets and levels of the respective test in the lenient condition.
